1. Run Confluent Cloud locally, or configure your `schemaRegistryUrl` in the `eventcatalog.config.js` file 
2. Run `npm run generate` to import your schemas from confluent schema registry.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

### What else can you do?

With the Confluent Schema Registry integration you can :
